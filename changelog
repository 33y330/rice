		- Apparently the first quick patch I made only allowed for a
		 small number of colours. Yet another quick patch with an
		 algorythm that's probably too complex for what it's supposed

		- Original author of pipes.sh unknown. A quick patch was made to		 stop the terminal from being spammed 70% of the time when it
		 ran.

		- Not my work, original Author's credits left in the heading 			 comments of the script. I will likely never make any

Possibly more coming soon.
