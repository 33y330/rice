pipes.sh
	2012/08/04
		- Apparently the first quick patch I made only allowed for a
		 small number of colours. Yet another quick patch with an
		 algorythm that's probably too complex for what it's supposed
		 to do, but it works.
	2012/08/03
		- Original author of pipes.sh unknown. A quick patch was made to
		 stop the terminal from being spammed 70% of the time when it
		 ran.

256color.pl
	2012/08/03
		- Not my work, original Author's credits left in the heading
		 comments of the script. I will likely never make any
		 modification to the script as there really is not anything
		 that I see could be modified for it to do anyway.

3spooky.lua
	2012/10/31
		- Not my work, and (as far as I know) originally posted on 
		pastebin ( http://pastebin.com/brwgHnCq ) and linked to
		on a thread on /g/

hax.exe (bash script - not an actual exe)
	2012/10/31
		- Silly shell script, "hacks" any valid domain you use it with.
		Possibly more features to come soon, ability to "fail" instead
		of "complete" some parts, be able to use another utility to
		look up domains instead of parsing output from ``host'', etc.

hackertyper.sh
	2012/10/31
		- Another silly shell script, made to somewhat copy 
		http://hackertyper.com/ The point of asking for a password for
		the supposed "hacking" part didn't really make sense to me after
		I wrote it but then I was too lazy to change it and turn that 
		off by default / have a switch to turn it on / etc.

Possibly more coming soon.
